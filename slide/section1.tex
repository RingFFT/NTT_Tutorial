\section{Introduction and Goal}

\begin{frame}{Motivation and Goals}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> \textbf{Core Problem}: Fast polynomial multiplication in 
          \(\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]/(x^n - 1)\), where \(n\) is a power of 2.\\
          The problems we deal with include more general quotient rings, 
          but in this slide, we firstly focus on such simple ring 
          for the purpose of illustration.
    \item<2-> \textbf{Background}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item In many applications in cryptography, we have to multiply the elements
                  in the ring of the kind \(\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]/(x^n - 1)\), 
                  which is a very time-consuming operation.
            \item Suppose we can perform such operation more efficiently, 
                  then in the same cost of computational resource (i.e., time),
                  we can perform such multiplication for larger \(n\), 
                  and thus improve the security level of the cryptographic scheme.
          \end{itemize}
